# Domestic-Airline-Data-Analysis-Project-2019
## Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 10,683 domestic flights in India from 2019, encompassing key attributes such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure and arrival times, duration, total stops, additional information, and ticket prices. The objective is to uncover actionable insights to address specific questions about flight distributions, pricing trends, and travel patterns, while also exploring additional trends to enhance understanding. Key analyses include the distribution of flights by stoppages, identification of the most expensive and cheapest flights, price variations by source city, flight frequency by day and month, and the impact of additional services on pricing.  A notable finding is that non-stop flights are often among the cheapest, challenging common assumptions about flight pricing.
