# Domestic-Airline-Data-Analysis-Project-2019
## Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 10,683 domestic flights in India from 2019, encompassing key attributes such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure and arrival times, duration, total stops, additional information, and ticket prices. The objective is to uncover actionable insights to address specific questions about flight distributions, pricing trends, and travel patterns, while also exploring additional trends to enhance understanding. Key analyses include the distribution of flights by stoppages, identification of the most expensive and cheapest flights, price variations by source city, flight frequency by day and month, and the impact of additional services on pricing.  A notable finding is that non-stop flights are often among the cheapest, challenging common assumptions about flight pricing.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to clean and preprocess the airline booking dataset to ensure accurate and reliable analysis. The project aims to explore how various factors—such as airline type, number of stops, travel duration, and journey timing—influence flight ticket prices. By conducting detailed exploratory data analysis, the goal is to identify meaningful pricing patterns, compare premium and budget airline strategies. Overall, this project demonstrates strong data analyst skills by transforming raw data into actionable business insights through effective visualization.

## Dataset Information
Total Records: 10,683 flights

Year: 2019

Region: Domestic flights within India

Format: .xlsx

File Used:Data_Train_xlsx

Key Columns: Airline, Date of Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Duration, Total Stops, Additional Info, Price

## Key Insights
The analysis reveals several important trends in airline ticket pricing. One-stop flights emerged as the most common option, suggesting that airlines optimize routes around shorter or single-stop journeys due to high demand. Premium carriers such as Jet Airways Business and Air India consistently offer the highest-priced tickets, while budget airlines like IndiGo and SpiceJet dominate the lower price segments. The study also highlights that ticket prices vary significantly based on journey timing, with peak-hour flights generally more expensive. Although flights with more stoppages usually have longer travel durations, these routes are not always cheaper—indicating that pricing also depends on demand and operational decisions. Together, these insights help illustrate how airline type, route structure, duration, and timing collectively influence airfare pricing.
